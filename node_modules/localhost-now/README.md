Am I the only one who is lazy to install Apache just for testing some HTML or JavaScript code (like XHR) ?


## Setup
`npm install -g localhost-now`

By installing this package, you will have the `smart` command available in your shell / terminal.

## API

`localhost [port]`

By default, the web server will run on the **1337 port**. You can set a custom port by specify the port when you
launch the server like for example : **localhost 8080**.
