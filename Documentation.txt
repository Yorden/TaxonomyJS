DOCUMENTATION

I think the project turned out pretty well.  I think I was able to get the amount of code down really low
and get it to be super reusable for different JSON files and I am very happy about that.  In terms of what
I could have done better, I think that I could have done a better job of making the code perfect.  The code
is pretty code, but it could always be better.  If I had a bit more time, I could have made the project fully scalable,
when right now the project is only scalable to 3 levels.

I think I did a good job when it came to the design of the app.  I like the fade ins I added to the selects.  I also like
the pictures that show up.  I think those are really cool.  There a bunch of requirements for part 2 of the project,
but I had completed them all for part 1 anyway, so all the functionality is all there.
